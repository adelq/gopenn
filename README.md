# Penn OpenData Go SDK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adelq/gopenn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adelq/gopenn)

This is the Penn OpenData API implementation in Go.

## Install

To get started, just run

```
go get github.com/adelq/gopenn
```

## Requesting an API key

To use this library, you must first obtain an API token and password for the API you want to use, which can be done [here](https://esb.isc-seo.upenn.edu/8091/documentation/#security).

**Note**: There are separate API tokens for each API.
